## Description
Jquery Form with imagery
<br>

## Objectives
- [x] DOM Manipulation Practice
Practice adding some interactivity to your web pages:
Follow along with the video and build a page that "talks" to the user.
Practice selecting certain HTML elements and changing the background color to green.
Now practice removing those elements, just like in the video.
Make a "cat vs dog" page - if you click a button for the cat to meow, the dog should bark back, and vice versa. Use Bootstrap to style your pages!
In addition to .prepend() and .append(), you can add content before or after the selected tags (rather than within them) with .before() and .after().
Make a page where if a user clicks on an element some sort of image gets inserted into the page before or after that element. Allow the new image to be removed by a click as well.
- [x] To practice font usage and styling so even simple pages look professional
